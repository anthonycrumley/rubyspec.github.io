## Runners and scripts

MSpec has several special-purpose runners scripts for various tasks like
running the specs, tagging specs, and running a particular subset of the specs
that are known to pass on a particular implementation. The runner scripts
essentially just collect your wishes, configure the moving parts of the MSpec
module, hand over control to MSpec, and get out of the way. The links below
describe each of the runner scripts in detail.

* [mspec](/mspec/)
* [mspec-run](/mspec-run/)
* [mspec-tag](/mspec-tag/)
* [mspec-ci](/mspec-ci/)

Since consistency is a boon to readability, MSpec provides a script to
generate template spec files. See the documentation for [mkspec](/mkspec/).
