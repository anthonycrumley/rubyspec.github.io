 h1. Contributing to RubySpec
 
 The simplest way to get started writing specs is to clone the main "Github
 repo":http://github.com/rubyspec/rubyspec/tree/master, install the mspec gem,
 and read the wiki documentation here. Once you have written a spec and
 committed it to your local clone, use @git format-patch@ to create a patch
 file and upload it in a "new ticket":/projects/rubyspec/issues/new. Please do
 not send pull requests.
 
 If you have questions, the quickest response is available in the @#rubyspec@
 channel on freenode. Or you can send a message to the "mailing
 list":http://groups.google.com/group/rubyspec
