h1. Current Standard

The current "standard" version of the MatzRuby for the specs is 1.8.6 patchlevel 114, which is not currently the official "stable version":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/, but it appears to be the version used by the vast majority of folks at the moment.

Refer to the documentation for "guards":/wiki/rubyspec/Guards, and in particular the @ruby_bug@ guard for how to work with potential bugs discovered in the current standard version.
