h1. MSpec Helpers
 
 h3. language_version
 
 Helper for syntax-sensitive specs. The specs should be placed in a file in
 the @versions@ subdirectory. For example, suppose language/method_spec.rb
 contains specs whose syntax depends on the Ruby version. In the
 language/method_spec.rb use the helper as follows:
 
 <pre>
   language_version __FILE__, "method"
 </pre>
 
 Then add a file "language/versions/method_1.8.rb" for the specs that are
 syntax-compatible with Ruby 1.8.x.
